      <h2>The History of pickles: </h2>
      <p>
        Pickled Cucumbers, or as they are more commenly known as, pickles, have a suprisngly long and vast history. <br> 
        Pickles are thought to be more then 4,000 years old! Some of the earliest known examples of pickles dates back to 2400 B.C. <br >
        when mesopotamians pickleed cucumbers for later consumption. It is even known that Cleopatra and Julius Caesar both ate pickles <br>
        since the first believed it improved her beauty, and the latter believed that it made you a more powerful warrior. <br>
        During the age of exploration, the popularity of pickles really took off. On his voyage to the Americas, Christopher Columbus <br>
        brought pickles with him on his trip, since they stayed good for a long period of time and prevented scurvy. During the 19th and 20th <br>
        centuries H.J. Heinz would start one of the successful pickling companies ever.

      <h2>The making of a pickle:</h2>
      <p> 
        Pickled cucumbers are made as their name suggests, pickling. A cucmber is submerged in a solution of acidic brine which ferments them <br>
        and makes them go sour and salty. The proccess is started by preparing the brine which is a mix of spices, which traditionally includes <br>
        garlic, horseradish, and dill. The most impostant ingrediant in the brin though is salt, lots and lots of salt. The more salt that you <br>
        add the more sour the pickle will turn out to be. The sourness of the pcikle is also influenced by the amount of time given to the <br>
        fermentation proccess of the pickles.

      <h2>The diffrent types of pickles:</h2>
      <p>
          There are a plethera of diffrent types of pickles. Types of pickles include: Bread-and-butter, Gherkin, Kosher dill, Hungarian, <br>
          Polish and German, and Lime. All these pickles differ mainly in the type of cucumber used and the ingredients used in the brine. <br>
          For example pickles such as the Bread-and-butter, and Polish are sweeter in comparison to the other types of pickles since <br> 
          their brine includes sugar. Pickles such as Gherkins are made with baby cucumbers while most other pickles are made with <br>
          full-size cucumbers.
